### Project Overview
This is a project called Manuscript which is my first assignment for Typography and Interaction 1 class in typsetting in HTML & CSS in the MPS Communication Design program at Parsons School of Design, The New School, Fall 2025. The goal of this project was to typset a written respons using HTML and CSS focusing on typographic hiearchy, readability, spacing, and basic interaction on the web. The assignment asked us to translate a written text into a structred, web-based layout while considering how typogrpahy functions differently on screen compared to print.

The article explores the explosion of gradients in visual culture and design which connects popularity to broader cultural, emotional and political context, including identity, nostalgia, and technology.
## Written Response / Reflection
My written response reflects on how gradients operate not only as a visual design trend but also as a metaphor for identity, culture and decision-making. I connect the article's discussion of blurred boundaries-across gender, sexuality, politics and technology to my own lived experience navigating between arab and american cultural frameworks. I was particularly interested in how gradients reject binary thinking and instead suggests fluidity, overlap, and transition. This idea resonated with my understanding of identity, branding, and even everyday experiences like coffee culture, where meaning and behavior shift depending on context. Through this response, I consider how color, branding and design choices influence emotion and perception often in subtle and unconscious ways. 

## Design & Technical Approach  
- Semantic HTML structure for headings, paragraphs and sections
- CSS used for typographic hiearchy, spacing, and readability
- Focus on clarity, restraint, and legibility rather than heavy visual styling
- Emphasis on translating written content into a clean, structured web layout
This project prioritizes typography and content structure as well as design along with the early stages of learning HTML and CSS for typsetting.

## Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code
